## :page_with_curl: What's it ?

Trivia is a knowledge quiz app. It allows users to see who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application provides functionnalities such as:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Users can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## :mag: About the Stack

### Backend

The [backend](./backend/README.md) directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server. Endpoints are defined in the `__init__.py` of the `flaskr` folder which references models and db config. 

Directory folders:

1. `backend/flaskr/__init__.py` : Flask app where endpoints are defined.
2. `backend/test_flaskr.py`: Unittest
3. `backend/models.py`: models for DB and SQLAlchemy setup

> View the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for more details.

### Frontend

The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. 

> View the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for more details.

##  ðŸ“–  API Reference

### Getting Started

- **Base URL**: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

- **Authentication**: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```json
{
    "success": false, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request",
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

- 400: Bad Request
